## üõ†Ô∏è Core Technologies Powering Numera

Numera is built with a robust and modern Android development stack, chosen for efficiency and a great developer experience:

* **Kotlin**: The primary language, enabling concise and safe code.
* **Jetpack Compose**: Powers the entire UI with a modern, declarative approach for faster development.
* **Dagger-Hilt**: Manages dependencies, promoting clean architecture.
* **Proto DataStore**: Persists user preferences (e.g., themes) in a type-safe manner.
* **Kotlinx Serialization**: Handles efficient data serialization for storage with Proto DataStore.
* **Google Truth**: A library for more readable and expressive assertions in tests.

## ‚úÖ Code Quality & Formatting

To ensure consistent code style and maintain high code quality, Numera utilizes **ktlint** with a pre-commit Git hook. This automatically formats Kotlin code and checks for linting errors before any code is committed.

* **Ktlint Integration**: Implemented via the Spotless Gradle plugin. [Learn more here](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/tree/main/plugin-gradle#applying-ktlint-to-kotlin-files).
